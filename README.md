# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

After careful analysis of previous Kickstarter ventures, there are several insights that we can arrive at. 
First, in the US Market, plays are one of the most successful ventures on kickstarter so this is good news for funding your play Fever.

## Timeline
Next, we should look at when to launch your campaign.

For plays in the US market the month of February is the best option for launch with a relatively high amount of play campaigns succeeding along with some of the lowest numbers failing. If this cannot be managed, the highest amount of successful campaigns begin at the beginning of summer between May to June, however many play campaigns also fail, meaning there just may be a higher concentration of campaigns launched during this period. 
At all costs avoid launching in December as this is the least succesful time period to launch.

## Budget
As shown in the Descriptive Statistics sheet, your proposed budget of over $10k may be risky for your campaign. In fact, using the IQR rule we can determine that a successful campaign at $10k would be an outlier in this data. I would propose trying to cut down your budget to at most around $5k as that is still in the upper quarter of budgets that succeeded and closer to the average successful campaign.

## Overseas Musical

Musical campaigns in Great Britain overall have failed more than they have succeeded. If you were to launch a campaign, it would be wise to launch with a maximum goal of $2k. 3/4 of the campaigns launched got less than $2k pledged so launching with any higher of a goal would be quite risky. Seeing as over a quarter of the campaigns never received a single pledge I would advise you to not attempt this project.
